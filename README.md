# Getting Started

## Building
To build the project, first run 

```shell
python sqlite/build.py
```

once to download & build the sqlite amalgamation, from then on
```shell
odin run ./Source -out:ATom
```
can be used to run the game.
`debug.py` is a wrapper for odin that runs the game under [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) if u have it

You'll of course need [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) installed, as the project is written in Odin.
